# Project Title : Airbnb House Price Prediction
# Problem Statement
- Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service that connects individuals who have space to rent, typically their homes or apartments, with travelers seeking accommodations. 
- The concept behind Airbnb is to provide an alternative to traditional hotels and offer a more personalized and authentic travel experience.
- Being such a gaint in its domain, Airbnb should maintain its customers with atmost satisfaction.
- Airbnb pricing is important to get right, particularly in big cities like London where there is lots of competition and even small differences in prices can make a big difference.
- It is also a difficult thing to do correctly — price too high and no one will book. Price too low and you’ll be missing out on a lot of potential income.
# Objective
- Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay.
- Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world. AirBnB provides a predictive pricing tool to hosts, but the tool has received complaints for not being accurate enough.
- Some hosts even believe AirBnB may be artificially decreasing prices to keep new customers coming into the platform. Hence i decided to develop a predictive model for AirBNB prices.
# Data Source
- Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way.
